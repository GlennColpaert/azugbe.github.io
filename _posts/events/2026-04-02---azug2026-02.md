### Minority Report: observing Azure, the pre-cog way
<img src="/assets/media/speakers/mike-martin.jpg" alt="Mike Martin" align="right" height="100" width="100" style="margin-right: 20px;">

Set in a near future where crime is stopped before it happens, Minority Report portrays a world ruled by foresight. A specialized police unit relies on three precognitive humans, the pre cogs, whose visions reveal murders before they occur. John Anderton, the unit’s chief investigator, enforces justice based on predicted intent rather than committed action. When he is himself accused of a future crime, he is forced to question the system he helped build and confront the danger of treating incomplete visions as absolute truth.

This session borrows that tension and applies it to Azure observability. Like the pre cogs, modern platforms should not merely surface numbers on a dashboard but reveal intent, sequence and consequence within applications. Minority Report reframes observability as an investigative discipline, shifting focus away from raw metrics toward application and functional understanding. Instead of asking what broke, we ask what was unfolding and why it mattered.

Using several Azure services and tools we can create the same experience like John Anderton/Tom Cruise did in the film (except for maybe without the classical music, but with metal or hard rock instead!) 

The goal is not perfect prediction, but pre knowledge through evidence.  Observability becomes less about surveillance and noise, and more about meaning, investigation and understanding what your systems are truly telling you.
